Even certain questions in harmonic analysis and PDE can be understood as Diophantine problems.\n\nThis project will use analytic techniques to study problems concerning polynomials in (algebraic or rational) integers. An extension or alternative is to use these Diophantine techniques to tackle problems in harmonic analysis or PDE, especially spectral multiplier estimates on compact manifolds and nilmanifolds.\n\nThe doctoral student could establish existence of solutions using modern forms of the Birch-Davenport circle method, or prove upper bounds using the sieve or determinant methods. Systems of equations with differing degrees, and cubic equations in three integer variables, are current frontiers in this area.\n\nAs a Doctoral student you will be part of an international research environment while you expand your knowledge of the field and write your thesis. This gives opportunities for many inspiring conversations, a lot of autonomous work and some travel.
