        "description": "We are looking for one Doctoral student at the divison of Algebra and Geometry. The research project will be at the interface of number theory and harmonic analysis and will be conducted within the research group of Simon Rydin Myerson.\n\nAbout us \nThe Department of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg has about 200 employees and is the largest department of mathematics in Sweden. We have an international environment with frequent exchanges with other universities around the world. We provide a friendly, creative, and supportive atmosphere with a steady flow of international guests. Equality and diversity are substantial foundations in all our activities. We work actively to be a parent-friendly organization.\n\nAt the Division of Algebra and Geometry we conduct research in areas such as algebraic geometry, complex geometry, number theory, mathematical physics and the mathematics of AI.\n\nAbout the research project  \nMany open questions in number theory, such as the Manin-Peyre conjecture, concern Diophantine equations. Even certain questions in harmonic analysis and PDE can be understood as Diophantine problems.\n\nThis project will use analytic techniques to study problems concerning polynomials in (algebraic or rational) integers. An extension or alternative is to use these Diophantine techniques to tackle problems in harmonic analysis or PDE, especially spectral multiplier estimates on compact manifolds and nilmanifolds.\n\nThe doctoral student could establish existence of solutions using modern forms of the Birch-Davenport circle method, or prove upper bounds using the sieve or determinant methods. Systems of equations with differing degrees, and cubic equations in three integer variables, are current frontiers in this area.\n\nAs a Doctoral student you will be part of an international research environment while you expand your knowledge of the field and write your thesis. This gives opportunities for many inspiring conversations, a lot of autonomous work and some travel. You are expected to develop your own ideas and communicate scientific results orally as well as in written form. In addition, the position will normally include 20% departmental work, mostly teaching duties\n\nWho we are looking for\nThe following requirements are mandatory:\n\n• To qualify as a Doctoral student, you must have a Master's degree (masterexamen) of 120 credits or a Master’s degree (magisterexamen) of 60 credits* in mathematics or a related field.\n• You will need strong written and verbal communication skills in English.\n• The project requires knowledge in either number theory, harmonic analysis, or algebraic geometry. It is advantageous to have knowledge in all of these fields.\n\n*for students with an education earned outside of Sweden, a 4-year Bachelor’s degree is accepted. \n\nWhat you will do\n\n• Take courses at an advanced level within the Graduate school of mathematics .\n• Develop your own scientific concepts and communicate the results of your research verbally and in writing. \n• The position generally also includes teaching on Chalmers' undergraduate level or performing other duties corresponding to 20 percent of working hours.\n\nContract terms  \n\n• The Doctoral student positions are fully funded from start. \n• The position is a fixed-term appointment of four years, with the possibility to teach up to 20%, which extends the position up to five years. \n• A starting salary of 34,550 SEK per month (valid from May 25, 2025). \n• Doctoral studies require physical presence throughout the entire study period. A valid residence permit must be presented by the study start date; otherwise the admission may be withdrawn. \n• The expected starting date is September 2026, or as agreed. \n\nWhat we offer \n\n• As a Doctoral student at Chalmers, you are an employee and enjoy all employee benefits. Read more about  working at Chalmers  and our benefits for employees. \n• A dynamic and inspiring working environment in the coastal city of Gothenburg. \n• Read more about Sweden’s generous parental leave, subsidized day care, free schools, healthcare etc at Move To Gothenburg. \n\nChalmers is dedicated to improving gender balance and actively works with equality projects, such as the GENIE Initiative for gender equality and excellence.
