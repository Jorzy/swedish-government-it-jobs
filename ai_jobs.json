We invite highly motivated candidates to apply for this PhD position at the Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nProject description\nThe continuous miniaturization of silicon-based electronics has driven the technological progress for decades. However, as devices now approach atomic scales, the fundamental laws of physics increasingly hinder further advances. To sustain the pace of innovation, both academia and industry have started exploring alternative materials, devices, and circuit architectures, particularly in the rapidly expanding field of AI hardware. Atomically thin two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors have emerged as highly promising candidates to either replace or significantly complement silicon in future electronics.\n\nIn this project, your PhD research will focus on developing novel memory and logic devices based on TMDs. These will target both near-term industrial applications and emerging neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing architectures for AI accelerator hardware. The project encompasses materials exploration, device physics, nanofabrication, and low-level system integration, benefiting from Chalmers' world-class cleanroom and uniquely well-equipped electrical characterization laboratory.\n\nUnder the supervision of Dr. Anton Persson, who recently joined from Stanford University, you will be a member of a team of PhD students and senior researchers from both industry and academia, working with semiconductor technology development, circuit design, and the realization of complete system demonstrations.\n\nQualifications\nTo qualify, you should hold an M.Sc. degree or a four-year B.Sc. degree in physics, material science, electrical engineering or a related field.
