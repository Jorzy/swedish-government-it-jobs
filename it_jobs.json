We focus on detecting and preventing criminal activity without registering the identity of regular citizens. At sensitive installations such as schools, our system anonymizes all individuals to hide their identity, to make sure that the invasion of privacy is kept at a zero level. This way, our system can detect what happens and alert, leading to reduced crime rates and increased safety without any negative effects on personal privacy. \nIrisity AB (publ) is a public company listed at OMX Nasdaq First North, with headquarters in Gothenburg. We currently employ a staff of 90+ people globally in development, sales, support, and finance. Our R&D department consists of a computer vision / machine learning team together with an excellent group of system architects, designers, and software developers. \nWe are now looking for more skilled, friendly, and passionate people who want to participate in making sure that the camera security industry ends up on the right side of history. \nAs a global company, we value diverse, inclusive teams that can contribute to our team success through their unique perspectives and experiences and backgrounds. \nWe are looking forward to receiving your application.
