The vision for Volvo Group is to be the most desired and successful transport and infrastructure solution provider in the world. We don’t sell trucks and machines: we operate the solutions through the full life cycle to maximize the improvements achievable through autonomy. \n \nThat goes hand in hand with our long-term ambitions: 100% Safe, 100% Fossil free and 100% more productive. The automation of our vehicles is seen as a natural step towards reaching that goal. Joining the Volvo Group means contributing to a large global company that is transforming itself towards these ambitions. We are committed to diversity and inclusion, fostering a team culture where differences are seen as a steppingstone to better results.\n \nHow we work\nThe Digital & IT team empowers V.A.S. to scale up by designing a modern, cloud-first IT landscape that maximizes synergies with Volvo Group. We take a holistic approach—balancing ambitious strategies with hands-on implementation—to ensure our tools and integrations work seamlessly together. Security and data are at the core of everything we do, with a zero-trust mindset and a strong focus on making data one of our most valuable assets.\n \nWe optimize where V.A.S. is unique and aligns with Volvo Group where it makes sense, adopting a multi-platform data strategy. This means using Microsoft Fabric for transport company-related analytics and Volvo Group’s platform (UDP) for other analyses. Our DPM BI/Analytics role is key to getting the most value from each platform, including ownership of MS Fabric, and collaborating closely with our Technology organization to leverage vehicle-centric data from sensors and other sources.\n \nWith a greenfield approach, we have the opportunity to embed high levels of automation into our processes, driving efficiency and reducing manual work as we grow. By combining advanced analytics, automation tools like Power Automate, AI agents, and API orchestration, we’re building a highly integrated, data-driven environment.\n \nBecause data and automation are so closely linked, we’re now bringing them together under one DPM, managing both end-to-end to unlock new insights and enable smarter, faster decisions across V.A.S.\n \nWho are you?\nWhile we haven’t met you yet, we picture you as a versatile professional—a connector and influencer who thrives in complex ecosystems. You bring a holistic perspective to Digital & IT, with broad expertise across solution architecture and BI/Analytics, spanning multiple domains and technologies.\n \nYou’re comfortable navigating the entire data value chain, from source systems to business insights, and you’re fluent in APIs, integration, orchestration, and automation. Embracing AI is second nature to you, and you’ve likely delivered real-world AI use cases.\n \nWe’re looking for someone who is both a strategic thinker and a hands-on doer—someone who can plan for the future but isn’t afraid to roll up their sleeves when needed. Your curiosity, adaptability, and can-do attitude mean you’re always ready to learn and take on new challenges. You communicate with ease, whether you’re engaging with C-suite leaders or collaborating with developers, architects, and analysts.\n \nAbove all, you’re a true generalist with a specialist’s depth—a “jack of all trades” who can bridge gaps across roles and disciplines. Your background might include experience as a solution architect, data platform owner, data scientist, data architect, hyper automation architect, or technical project manager, supported by a relevant university degree or equivalent professional experience.\n \nResponsibilities:\nAs a Solution Architect and DPM for BI/Analytics & Automation, you will play a pivotal role in shaping a modern, scalable, and efficient IT landscape that supports our transformation into an autonomous Transport-as-a-Service provider.
