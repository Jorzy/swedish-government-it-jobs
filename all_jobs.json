    "description": "Postdoctoral Researcher in Modeling Anthropometric Variability Using Deep Machine Learning\n\nWe are looking for a postdoctoral researcher to join our international team at the forefront of human body modeling for injury prediction. In this project, you will apply state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to medical imaging data to develop statistical shape models (SSMs) of the human skeleton. The work is carried out within a world-leading research group, and the models you help develop will be open-source—contributing to scientific progress and increasing your visibility in the field.\n\nProject description\n\nTo design human body models that reflect population variability—such as differences in age, sex, height, and BMI—SSMs are essential. These models describe how such covariates relate to 3D anatomical shapes, including the body’s outer form, bones, and internal organs.\n\nTraditionally, building SSMs requires extensive manual work, including segmentation and landmarking of CT or MRI images. However, recent advances in AI/ML make it possible to automate much of this process. Pilot studies, including master's theses conducted in collaboration with other Chalmers departments, have already shown promising results using predictive deep learning on medical images.\n\nThe aim of this postdoc project is to establish a pipeline for (semi-)automated segmentation and landmarking of full-body skeletal structures. Starting from manually processed data and existing models, you will process a large dataset of medical images to extract skeletal geometries. These will be standardized using mesh morphing techniques and expressed through a common template mesh (VIVA+), developed by our research group. Once aligned, the data can be statistically analyzed to produce models that predict skeletal geometry as a function of key covariates.\n\nResearch environment\n\nAt the Department of Mechanics and Maritime Sciences (M2), the engineers and researchers of tomorrow are trained with their eyes set on the transition to a sustainable transport system. Our research portfolio is unique and covers all modes of transport and contributes to environmentally friendly process technology and sustainable energy supply. Through collaboration with the society and industry, we strive to solve society's major challenges – together.\n\nYou will be based at the Division of Vehicle Safety, specifically in the Injury Prevention (IP) research group. Our work spans from accident causation and driver behavior to injury biomechanics and whole-body responses to mechanical loading. Since 2009, we have been active in Human Body Modeling (HBM), collaborating closely with industry partners and SAFER – the Vehicle and Traffic Safety Centre at Chalmers.\n\nOur focus today is on developing HBMs that represent the entire population and can predict injury risk across both conventional and emerging mobility scenarios. The research is highly collaborative, involving automotive industry leaders, universities, research institutes, public agencies, and insurance companies.\n\nMain responsibilities\nAs a post-doc, you will be responsible for processing the data from medical images into a SSM. This includes communicating with other research groups at Chalmers, with medical staff from where the data originates, and with researchers at other Universities. You are also expected to participate in teaching activities about 10% of your working time. Typically, this would be in some of the courses the research group is offering.\n\nQualifications\n\n\n• A PhD in Mechanics, Physics, or a related discipline, awarded no more than three years before the application deadline*.\n• Completed coursework in deep machine learning.\n• Hands-on experience training deep learning models using Python and libraries such as PyTorch.\n• Strong self-motivation and the ability to work independently.\n• Excellent communication skills and fluency in English, both written and spoken.\n\nMeritorious qualifications:\n\n\n• Knowledge of the finite element method.\n• Experience working with medical imaging data.\n• Background in human anatomy.\n\n * The date shown in your doctoral degree certificate is the date we use, as this is the date you have met all requirements for the doctoral degree. Exceptions from the 3-year limit can be made for longer periods resulting from parental leave, sick leave or military service.\n\nContract terms\nThis postdoc position is a full-time temporary employment for two years.\n\nWhat we offer \n Chalmers provides a cultivating and inspiring working environment in the coastal city of Gothenburg. \n Read more about working at Chalmers and our benefits for employees.\n\nChalmers aims to actively improve our gender balance. We work broadly with equality projects, for example the GENIE Initiative on gender equality for excellence. Equality and diversity are substantial foundations in all activities at Chalmers.\n\nApplication procedure\nThe application should be written in English and be attached as PDF-files, as below. Maximum size for each file is 40 MB. Please note that the system does not support Zip files.\n\nCV: (Please name the document as: CV, Surname) including:\n• CV, include complete list of publications\n• Previous teaching and pedagogical experiences\n\nPersonal letter: (Please name the document as: Personal letter, Family name)\n1-3 pages where you:\n• Introduce yourself \n• Describe your previous research fields and main research results\n• Describe your future goals and future research focus\n\nOther documents:\n• Attested copies of completed education, grades and other certificates.\n\nUse the button at the foot of the page to reach the application form.\n\n Please note: The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the application is complete.

    "employer": "Chalmers Tekniska Högskola AB",
    "location": "Göteborg",
    "description": "We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to join our international team at the forefront of microwave radiative transfer and data retrieval. In this project, you will utilise data from the new generation of European satellite-based microwave radiometers to derive information on the Arctic atmosphere. In particular, the project enables you to be among the first to apply the novel sub-millimetre observations provided by the Arctic Weather Satellite and the Ice Cloud Imager.\n\n About us and the research project \nWe are developing advanced approaches for retrieving atmospheric data from the Arctic Weather Satellite (AWS) as well as the upcoming Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) and Microwave Imager (MWI) instruments. When launched in 2024, AWS became the first operational satellite to perform measurements at sub-millimetre wavelengths through four channels around 325 GHz. ICI will extend the frequency coverage further, up to 664 GHz. These new channels provide better characterisation of ice hydrometeors, and we have a central position for both AWS and ICI to ensure that this information is fully utilised for, e.g., climate applications. The development and use of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS) are central to our work. The retrievals are performed by advanced machine learning. \n\nThe successful candidate will join our team and have a main responsibility for the development and validation of retrievals covering the Arctic region. Initially, the work focuses on AWS and will be performed as a project inside the ESA Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI). Following the launch of MWI and ICI (late 2026), retrievals that utilise those instruments will also be part of the activities. Throughout, the core task is to produce novel cloud products making use of the new measurement capabilities offered by the instruments of concern. Performing\nadvanced radiative transfer calculations by ARTS is a key component of the work. Participating in the development of ARTS can be of concern. You will also receive training in using machine learning to retrieve data from satellite observations. All in collaboration with the rest of the team.\n\nResearch environment\nThe Geoscience and Remote Sensing division at Chalmers conducts research, education, and utilisation within various scientific and engineering disciplines, including ground-based, airborne and satellite measurements, numerical modelling and data analysis. The division's goals are to enhance understanding of the Earth system and global environmental issues, and to provide and interpret global datasets. We pursue scientific knowledge and provide tools to tackle problems of importance to society, such as climate change, Earth system science, air pollution, natural hazards and monitoring of the Earth's surface. We have extensive experience in developing and applying remote sensing across the electromagnetic spectrum and studying problems at different scales, from molecular processes in clouds to global environmental change. Our setting is distinctive in Sweden in that we have expertise in developing measurement techniques and modelling and methods to combine data from observations and models through data assimilation and machine learning methods.\n \n Who we are looking for\nWe seek candidates with the following qualifications:\nApplicants must hold a PhD degree in remote sensing, meteorology, physics, mathematics, or a closely related field. You must hold a doctoral degree awarded no more than three years prior to the application deadline. *\n\nAdditional requirements:\n\n\n• Experience in radiative transfer and/or atmospheric remote sensing.\n• Good written and verbal communication skills in English.\n• Strong skills in programming (particularly Python and C/C++) and data\nanalysis.\n• Track record of scientific publications in international peer-reviewed journals.\n\nMeritorious qualifications include:\n\n\n• Data retrieval by machine learning or traditional methods.\n• Knowledge of the Arctic atmosphere or cloud physics in general.\n• The ability to work as part of a team.\n\nYou are expected to be somewhat accustomed to teaching, and to demonstrate good potential within research and education.\n\n* The date shown in your doctoral degree certificate is the date we use, as this is the date you have met all requirements for the doctoral degree. Exceptions from the 3-year limit can be made for longer periods resulting from parental leave, sick leave or military service.\n\nWhat you will do\nAs a postdoctoral researcher, your primary responsibility is to conduct and publish research. \nThe work will include:\n\n\n• Testing out ice hydrometeor particle models suitable for the Arctic region.\n• Improve our radiative transfer simulations over snow-covered and sea-ice\nsurfaces.\n• Generate databases of simulated observations for training machine learning\nretrieval models.\n• Analyse results, including comparison with other data derived from other\nsatellite sensors (such as EarthCARE)\n\nIf there is interest, the position can also offer opportunities for teaching. Cosupervision of PhD students will be encouraged.\n\nWhat we offer\n\nChalmers provides a cultivating and inspiring working environment in the coastal city of Gothenburg. \nRead more about working at Chalmers and our benefits for employees.\n\nChalmers aims to actively improve our gender balance. We work broadly with equality projects, for example the GENIE Initiative on gender equality for excellence. Equality and diversity are substantial foundations in all activities at Chalmers.\n\nIf Swedish is not your native language, Chalmers offers Swedish courses to help you settle in.\n\nContract terms\nThis postdoc position is a full-time temporary employment for two years, with possibility for extension subject to availability of funds.\n\nRead more and apply HERE\n\nApplication deadline: July 6, 2025\nIt is advisable to apply early due to the upcoming summer holiday period.

    "description": "Are you curious about harnessing the unique flavour properties of micro- and macroalgae? In this project at Chalmers University of Technology, challenges and possibilities with algae as food ingredients will be explored, maximizing the acceptance of algae-containing foods on the European market.\n\nThe division of Food and Nutrition Science (FNS) is one of four research divisions at the Department of Life Sciences (LIFE) at Chalmers. FNS addresses major societal challenges related to sustainable food production, nutrition and health. We conduct fundamental and applied research, innovation, education and dissemination in Food and Nutrition Science with the aim to provide new knowledge and solutions that pave the way for a sustainable planet and healthy humans. Research topics span from food chemistry and food technology to molecular and data- driven nutrition (Precision Nutrition).\n\nIn Food Science, we focus primarily on marine and plant-based food systems for which we develop tools and processes to promote high food quality, minimize losses throughout the value chain and allow nutrient recovery from alternative biomasses.\n\nIn nutrition, we focus on human observational and intervention studies as well as cell- based model studies and apply advanced data-driven approaches and state of the art biochemical and OMICs technologies to understand and predict the role of foods, dietary components and dietary patterns in human health. The research is also related to global food security topics in an international context.\n\nAbout the research project \nBoth microalgae and macroalgae (i.e. seaweed) have emerged as highly promising food sources based on their low climate impact production, their water purifying properties and their unique nutrient profiles. However, a widespread adoption of algal biomass in food is not yet fully in place on the European markets.\n\nThe EU-project AlgFlavor addresses knowledge gaps and challenges hindering an increased integration of algae into European diets. It will specifically harness the broad diversity of flavor profiles among different marine micro- and macroalgae, which ultimately depend on cultivation and post harvest processing.\n\nAs a PhD-student, you will be part of research to tailor the flavor profile of algae, as well as to explore its translation into algae-containing food products with diverse flavour requirements. Among crucual parts are to control key reactions generating volatile compounds in algae, as well to unravel their dependance on different food matrices.\n\nResults of the project will boost diversification of our food system, stimulating algae as a sustainable food commodity of high acceptance and ultimately enhance food security. The work will be carried out in close collaboration between academic and industrial partners paving the way for fast implementation of project results.\n\nWe seek candidates with the following qualifications:\n\n\n• To qualify as a PhD student, you must have a master's level degree in Biotechnology, Chemistry, Bioscience, Food Science, Food technology, Biochemical engineering, Biochemistry, Sustainable production & utilization of marine bioresources, or similar. Equivalent requirements apply to individuals with an education earned outside of Sweden, for example a 4-year bachelor's degree is accepted.\n• Fluent written and verbal communication skills in English\n• Strong communication and analytical skills\n\nThe following experience will strengthen your application:\n\n\n• Research experience from work with micro- and/or macroalgae, algae processing, algae quality, analytical chemistry/food analysis, volatile compound analysis.\n\nWhat you will do\n\n\n• Take courses at an advanced level within the Graduate school of Bioscience\n• Develop your own scientific concepts and communicate the results of your research verbally and in writing\n• The position generally also includes teaching on Chalmers' undergraduate level or performing other duties corresponding to 20 per cent of working hours\n\nContract terms and what we offer\n\n\n• The PhD position is fully funded from start\n• As a PhD student at Chalmers, you are an employee and enjoy all employee benefits.

    "employer": "Vattenfall AB",
    "location": "Göteborg",
    "description": "Company Description\nAt Vattenfall, we are determined to enable fossil freedom. To succeed, we must first become fully fossil-free ourselves as one of Europe’s largest energy companies. But that is not enough. To contribute to a fossil-free society, we need to do more than just focus on sustainable energy production.\nWe believe that enabling fossil freedom requires us to address the challenge from a broader perspective than merely producing energy sustainably.\nTo enable the fossil freedom that drives society forward – this is our purpose. We are looking for talented students who want to help us on our journey towards fossil freedom. By writing a thesis at Vattenfall, you will have a unique opportunity to contribute to our purpose.\nJoin us on the journey towards fossil freedom! \nJob Description\nVattenfall Eldistribution AB is Sweden’s largest Distribution System Operator (DSO), managing around 9,000 km of 130 kV overhead lines. We face challenges in increasing electric power transmission, as power lines are currently rated based on static summer or winter conditions. Building new lines is expensive and often controversial.\nFor several years, we’ve used Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) based on weather measurements to increase capacity on some lines. However, this approach is difficult to scale for larger volumes. Therefore, Vattenfall Eldistribution is exploring an innovative solution: DLR using phasor measurements. This technology uses synchronized voltage and current measurements at the ends of power lines to calculate real-time power loss and line temperature, enabling dynamic ratings based on local weather conditions.\nScope \nThis Master Thesis aims to clarify the mathematical foundations of DLR based on phasor measurements. The first step is to describe some commercial products using this method, and summarize international experiences in the field. The second step assesses the equations, including conditions, limitations and expected inaccuracies. Finally, a thorough assessment of the measurement chain is conducted, including a sensitivity analysis. How will measurement transformer inaccuracies or failing time synchronization affect the result? How accurately can the power lines (temperature dependent) resistance be expressed? What is the overall assessment of DLR based on phasor measurements?\nKey question: How accurately can an overhead line medium temperature be calculated?\nLimitations: 130 kV overhead lines only\n\nQualifications\nWe are looking for a student or students who want to work toward fossil-free living and are soon graduating from their academic studies. You are also someone who identifies with our principles: Active, Open, Positive, and Safety-focused.\nEducation: Enrolled in a master’s program in Technical Mathematics, Electric Power, or Theoretical Physics\nAvailability: Open to 1 or 2 master’s students\nLanguage Request: Ability to present in Swedish at our Trollhättan office\n\nAdditional Information\nDuration: Sep -Dec 2025 (start date as agreed)\nLocation: Gothenburg\nApplication: A single file with CV and grades.\nLast date for application: 2025-06-30\nContact at Vattenfall: Tor Johansson, tor1.johansson@vattenfall.com, 0730-856 407\n\nDiversity and Inclusion – In Everything We Do\nWe are convinced that heterogeneous teams can outperform homogeneous ones. But we can only unlock the power of diversity when everyone feels included.
